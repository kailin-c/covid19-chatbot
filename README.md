# COVID-19 Chatbot (SigmaHacks 2.0 Submission)

Nowadays, with many people getting their news as headlines off of social media, misinformation is a serious problem. With the COVID-19 pandemic, 
itâ€™s especially important to be well-informed of health guidelines and regulations to keep yourself and other people safe.
While people are encouraged to read government websites and reputable newspapers, with so much information on the web, this can seem like a daunting task.
As such, we decided to develop a friendly, easy-to-use chatbot which can answer questions about COVID-19.

Here is the link to the chatbot we created using IBM Cloud's Watson Assistant: https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/preview.html?region=us-east&integrationID=b498a8c3-63e5-424b-95f3-f65e048e6dd5&serviceInstanceID=67a7fd67-295d-4686-8ff2-41b6142f1d71

We also created a similar chatbot using JavaScript (including aichaos's rivescript-js library, whose copywrite and permission notices are shown below in accordance with their policy) and html, 
in the hopes of adding a news feature using a News API. You can view the source and test out this chatbot from our glitch page: https://glitch.com/~covid19-chatbot

We hope you enjoy our submission!
